# AngularJS at Devsigner 2014


For those of you near Portland interested in seeing me speak in person, I'll
be giving my "HTML Reloaded" presentation at
[Devsigner](http://devsignercon.com) this weekend.  Devsigner conference is
for "the coders who paint and the designers who send pull requests." It's a
rather timely endeavor, in my opinion, as I've recently noticed increasing
crossover between the graphic design and developer worlds. The advent of CSS
compilers like Sass and Less, and of frontend frameworks like AngularJS, seem
to be both a result and a cause of this. I'm looking forward to seeing what
other people have to say about this emerging cross-disciplinary field.
