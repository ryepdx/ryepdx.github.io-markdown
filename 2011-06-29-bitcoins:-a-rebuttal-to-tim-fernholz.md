# Bitcoins: A rebuttal to Tim Fernholz


Tim Fernholz:

[This](http://www.good.is/post/why-bitcoin-is-a-scam/) is one of the worst-
written articles about Bitcoin I've read so far. Certainly not worthy of your
publication's name. If you don't understand something, don't write about it.
:-p

Your description of mining is so broken I'm not even going to try to fix it.
Just do some more reading of low-level descriptions until you understand how
very wrong your description of miners as "decoders" is.

"...it's a massive experiment in group trust."  
Bitcoin is far from an experiment in group trust. It's guiding principle is
*distrust* of everything but the copy of the block chain residing on your own
hard drive. Your statement seems to find its roots in your ignorance of the
network's mechanics.

"That's a crazy amount of money to have stolen..."  
Yep, that's a lot of money to have stolen. The moral of the story is that if
you have over a quarter of a million dollars worth of bitcoins sitting on your
hard drive, *take some steps to secure them!* This is new ground for most
people, but honestly it's nothing that can't be learned. To help the everyman,
wallets will likely be encrypted and password protected in future versions of
the Bitcoin client.

"Bitcoin is a libertarian's dream come true..."  
Not just a dream come true for libertarians. Also a dream come true for anyone
who has ever pined for a convenient, politically neutral international
currency, or an easy, cheap way of engaging in micro-transactions.

"So far, you can't buy anything with bitcoins that you couldn't purchase more
easily with cash or a credit card."  
Aside from anything your government or credit card processor (assuming the
vendor isn't close enough for a physical cash transaction) doesn't want you
buying, that is. Most American citizens probably won't care much about this
one, save for all the folks who've had their PayPal accounts frozen at one
point or another, or all those folks who support privately embargoed
organizations like Wikileaks.

"...major exchanges like MtGox have fallen to hackers."  
The theft of $1,000 USD due to a *financial auditor's* gaffe is hardly grounds
for declaring Mt. Gox "fallen to hackers." Also, can you point out to me one
other exchange that has been similarly compromised? Because you're using the
plural, which implies there was more than one. Oh, there wasn't? You mean you
got your facts wrong *again?* Oh snap! :-p

"...the system presents a huge opportunity for big fish to take advantage of
the Internet everyman."  
You're right, the central banking system is WAY better. Those bankers are so
honest and adept at managing our money! They would NEVER take bonuses using
taxpayer money right after tanking the global economy. SO much fairer.

Should I beat you over the head with that one some more, or do you get it? :-p

"...Bitcoin won't work because it accrues such a huge advantage to people who
can bring the most computing power to bear on clearing transactions."  
You mean kinda like credit card companies? Herp derp.

" If any single person or group controlled a majority of computing power in
the network..."  
...they could have hacked your bank account a long time ago.

"It's hard to trust a monetary system concocted and managed by anonymous
hackers..."  
Not really managed by them. If anyone deviates from the network's protocol,
they isolate themselves from the network. The official client gets pretty
features added to it every once in a while by a guy named Gavin Andresen and
five other developers, of whom only Satoshi is anonymous, to help out herp
derps like yourself, but the essential elements never change. Although there
*is* a continuous stream of essentially anonymous code auditors who spend
their spare time reading the client's source code on the project's Github
page. Perhaps those were the "anonymous hackers" you're talking about?

Or maybe it's the guys running Mt. Gox. You know, the same ones whose security
was compromised because they were trying to comply with government regulations
and the freaking financial auditor ended up having a freaking virus on his
system. Those guys are ano-- oh wait, it's run by K.K. Tibanne Co, a totally
legitimate Japanese company.

To be fair, there are a lot of tiny garage startups that make up a good
portion of the rest of the Bitcoin economy. I'd say that's a good thing,
though: I've never heard anyone complain about an economy having too many
startups, or too much innovation, or too many opportunities. It's ultimately
an indication of the innovation and further democratization of the global
economy that Bitcoin encourages.

"Bitcoin still offers a glimpse of a future in which the dollar is
digitized..."  
Oh, cool. So right after complaining about the pitfalls of a digital currency
("that's a crazy amount of money to have stolen by someone essentially copying
a file from your hard drive," remember?) you're then going to advocate a
system that not only has THOSE pitfalls, but also the pitfalls of our current
centralized banking system. Awesome. Well done. Herp to the friggin' derp.
