# Things coming


Since my last post, I've decided that I really ought to do as much as possible
with other people's code. It seems to me that "Don't Repeat Other People"
ought to be considered almost as important as "Don't Repeat Yourself."

The fact is that Wordpress has been a quite serviceable platform for me so
far, and I don't really want to expend a bunch of effort writing a whole new
blogging platform. I don't have much reason for doing so, to be honest, and I
will probably be of more use to more people if I build my new platform using
other people's components as much as possible

At present, I'm of the mind to set up some sort of pub-sub server and to use
that to loosely join a bunch of different software platforms into a symbiotic
ecosystem of parts.
