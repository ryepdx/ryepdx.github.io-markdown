# Torrent This Post


Every post on this blog can now be torrented, thanks to the ["BitTorrent My
Blog" Wordpress plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/bittorrent/) by
[Maymay](http://maymay.net). (Maymay is perhaps better known for writing the
Predator Alert Tool family of apps and plugins for use with social networks
like [Facebook](https://apps.facebook.com/predator-alert-tool/) and
[OkCupid](https://github.com/meitar/pat-okcupid/).) If you're using [the
Maelstrom browser](http://blog.bittorrent.com/2014/12/10/project-maelstrom-
the-internet-we-build-next/), you will be torrenting and seeding this blog by
default.

If you want to torrent any post on my blog, just add "/webseed" to the URL.
For example, this post's torrent can be found at [http://ryepdx.com/2015/03
/torrent-this-post/webseed](http://ryepdx.com/2015/03/torrent-this-
post/webseed).

If you find yourself using and enjoying this plugin yourself, please consider
[donating to Maymay](http://maymay.net/#how-you-can-support-me). They live as
a kind of modern-day ascetic, doing what work needs doing and asking for no
payment aside from that which is freely given. Every little bit helps.
