# PGP Keys

## Subkeys seem... questionable.

For a long time I've had "get my cryptographic house in order" on the ol' to-do
list. Relying on one key for all security domains has never sat all that well
with me, but addressing this has been delayed by my need to do things
"properly." I figured subkeys were the "proper" way to address this issue, and
so I kept putting it off until I had enough time to devote to understanding
them.

In short, subkeys make a simple idea complicated. All I want are hierarchical
keys, but there's a whole new set of caveats and workflows to learn in order to
do things "properly," and for what? As far as I can tell, there is no
discernable advantage to using subkeys as conceptualized by GPG rather than
issuing a root public key, and then issuing separate keys signed by the
root key. In fact, subkeys apparently introduce unintuitive "gotchas" such as:

> One might be tempted to have one subkey per machine so that you only need to
> exchange the potentially compromised subkey of that machine. In case of a
> single subkey used on all machines, it needs to be exchanged on all machines
> in case of a compromising.

I don't want two sets of logic, one for keys and one for subkeys. I just want
to sign and encrypt things! Subkeys seem to occlude what should be transparent.

So this is what I've done: I will no longer be using my old root key, with its
automatically-attached subkeys. My new "root" key can only sign things. It will
be only used for signing statements about the validity of other keys, and
perhaps in a web-of-trust setting at some point.

My new root key is both signed by my old root key, and also referenced in a
statement clearsigned by my old root key. (If you don't have my old root key
already, don't worry about it.)

I'm also issuing a new PGP key for general use. It's signed by my new root key,
and also referenced in a clearsigned statement.

If you want to contact me, use my "ryepdx's laptop" key.

If you receive a signed statement about a new key, check it against my "root"
key.

I will append new keys and statements to this blog post as needed.
