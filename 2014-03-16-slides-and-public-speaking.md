# Slides and public speaking


I have added a ["Slides" page](http://ryepdx.com/slides/ "Slides" ) to hold
all the slides I use in my public speaking engagements. All my slides are
available under the [GNU Free Documentation
License](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/fdl.html). If you are interested in
engaging me as a public speaker, particularly if you want me to present on one
of the slide decks I've already posted, please [send me a
tweet](http://twitter.com/ryepdx).
