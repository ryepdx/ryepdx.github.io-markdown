# Lifestreaming


Boy, has it been a busy last couple months! I got a job at a startup so that's
consuming my life. The rock tour never took off, though I did end up going to
Canada. Now I have a few seconds before I run off to participate in my
writer's group.

I'm starting up the first bits of the Lifestream project. To keep from
annoying people too much, I'm relegating it all to certain channels. The first
channel is up:

Check it out.

Ciao!
